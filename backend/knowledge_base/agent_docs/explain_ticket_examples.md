# Explain My Ticket – Example Responses

## Purpose
These examples help agents explain refund decisions clearly, consistently, and transparently to customers. Use these as templates to build trust and reduce confusion [web:6][web:12][web:20].

**Key Principles:**
- Always cite **specific policy clauses** or evidence.
- Use **neutral, empathetic language** (see `tone_policy_agent.md`).
- Provide **actionable next steps** where applicable.
- Avoid jargon; explain technical terms in plain language.

## Category: Approved Refunds

### **Example 1: Standard Policy-Compliant Approval**
**Scenario:** Customer submitted valid damage claim within return window.

> "Your refund has been approved because the photos you provided clearly show shipping damage to the product packaging and the item itself, which aligns with our Damage Protection Policy (Clause 3.1 – Shipping Damage). Since you submitted the request within 7 days of delivery, you meet all eligibility criteria. The refund of ₹1,249 will be processed to your original payment method within 3-5 business days."

**Why this works:** Specific evidence cited, policy referenced, timeline provided [web:6][web:12][attached_file:22].

---

### **Example 2: AI-Verified Defect Approval**
**Scenario:** AI Damage Scanner confirmed manufacturing defect with high confidence.

> "Your refund request has been approved. Our AI Quality Verification system analyzed the images you submitted and confirmed a manufacturing defect (cracked screen assembly) with 92% confidence. This qualifies under our Electronics Defect Policy. The full refund of ₹15,999 will be credited within 3-5 business days. You do not need to return the defective product—please dispose of it safely."

**Why this works:** Explains AI role transparently, provides confidence score, clarifies no-return process [web:1][web:11][attached_file:30].

---

### **Example 3: Goodwill Approval (Outside Policy)**
**Scenario:** Request slightly outside policy window, but approved as customer loyalty gesture.

> "While your return request was submitted on day 8 (one day beyond our standard 7-day window for Fashion items), we've reviewed your account history and see you're a valued long-term customer with no prior returns. As a one-time goodwill gesture, we've approved your refund of ₹2,499. Please note that future returns must be submitted within the policy timeframe to qualify."

**Why this works:** Acknowledges policy breach, explains exception reasoning, sets future expectation [web:6][web:12][attached_file:29].

---

### **Example 4: Partial Refund Approval**
**Scenario:** Product returned with missing accessories.

> "Your refund has been partially approved. The main product (Bluetooth Speaker) is in acceptable condition, but the charging cable and user manual are missing from the return package. Per our Electronics Return Policy (Clause 4.2 – Missing Components), we've deducted ₹450 for the missing accessories. Your partial refund of ₹3,549 (original price ₹3,999 minus ₹450) will be processed within 3-5 business days."

**Why this works:** Breakdown of calculation, policy cited, transparency on deduction [web:12][web:20][attached_file:30].

---

## Category: Rejected Refunds

### **Example 5: Policy Window Expired**
**Scenario:** Request submitted after category return window closed.

> "Unfortunately, we cannot approve your refund request for this apparel item. Our Fashion & Clothing Return Policy allows returns within 7 days of delivery, and your request was submitted on day 12. Since the product was delivered on October 15 and the return window closed on October 22, we're unable to process this request under our standard policy. If you believe there are exceptional circumstances (e.g., delivery delay, medical emergency), please reply with supporting documentation for supervisor review."

**Why this works:** Clear timeline breakdown, offers escalation path for edge cases [web:6][web:12][attached_file:21].

---

### **Example 6: Insufficient Evidence**
**Scenario:** Photos do not show claimed damage.

> "We've reviewed the images you submitted for your refund request. Unfortunately, the photos do not clearly show the damage you described (cracked display). The images appear to show the product in working condition with no visible defects. To proceed, please submit additional evidence showing: (1) Close-up photos of the damaged screen from multiple angles, (2) A short video demonstrating the defect. You have 48 hours to provide this evidence. If you need guidance on what to photograph, our Help Center has examples under 'Evidence Requirements.'"

**Why this works:** Specific evidence gaps identified, clear resubmission instructions, helpful resource link [web:6][web:12][attached_file:29].

---

### **Example 7: Non-Returnable Item**
**Scenario:** Item category explicitly excluded from returns.

> "We're unable to approve a refund for this product (wireless earphones) as it falls under our Hygiene & Safety Exclusions list. Per our Electronics Return Policy (Clause 5.1 – Non-Returnable Items), earphones and headphones cannot be returned once the packaging seal is broken, due to health and hygiene standards. This policy was displayed on the product page at the time of purchase. If the product is defective, please initiate a warranty claim instead (covered for 12 months from purchase date)."

**Why this works:** Policy cited, reason explained (hygiene), alternative path provided (warranty) [web:6][web:20][attached_file:21].

---

### **Example 8: Customer-Caused Damage**
**Scenario:** AI detected damage inconsistent with shipping/manufacturing defect.

> "After reviewing your case, we're unable to approve the refund. The damage shown in your photos (deep scratches on the product surface) is inconsistent with shipping damage or manufacturing defects. Our AI Quality Verification system flagged the damage pattern as post-delivery wear and tear. Our Return Policy (Clause 3.3) covers only shipping damage or factory defects, not damage occurring after delivery. If you believe this assessment is incorrect, you may request a supervisor review by providing additional context (e.g., unboxing video, delivery condition photos)."

**Why this works:** AI analysis explained, policy clause cited, appeals process offered [web:1][web:11][attached_file:30].

---

### **Example 9: Stock Photo / Fraud Flag**
**Scenario:** Customer submitted stock image instead of actual product photo.

> "We're unable to process your refund request at this time. The image you submitted appears to be a stock photo from the product listing, not a photo of the actual item you received. To ensure fairness and policy compliance, we require authentic images of the product in your possession. Please submit new photos showing: (1) The product with visible serial number or unique identifiers, (2) The product alongside your order confirmation or packing slip. You have 48 hours to provide updated evidence."

**Why this works:** Non-accusatory language ("appears to be"), clear resubmission requirements, maintains neutrality [web:1][web:11][attached_file:25].

---

## Category: Escalations

### **Example 10: High-Value Escalation**
**Scenario:** Refund amount exceeds agent approval threshold.

> "Your refund request for ₹18,999 requires supervisor approval due to the order value. This is a standard procedure for high-value returns to ensure thorough review. I've escalated your case to our senior support team (Reference ID: ESC-2025-1145). You'll receive an update within 4 hours. All the evidence you've provided has been forwarded, and no further action is needed from your side at this time."

**Why this works:** Explains why escalation is needed (not customer's fault), provides reference ID and timeline [web:6][web:12][attached_file:23].

---

### **Example 11: Vendor QC Required**
**Scenario:** Product requires vendor quality verification before refund approval.

> "Since this product is vendor-managed (Home Decor category), we've forwarded your return to the vendor for quality inspection as per our Return Policy (Clause 6.1 – Vendor-Managed Returns). The vendor has 48 hours to complete their inspection. Once they confirm the product condition, we'll process your refund immediately. I've flagged your case as priority to ensure timely review. Expected update by: November 16, 6:00 PM IST."

**Why this works:** Explains vendor role, sets clear expectations, provides specific deadline [web:6][web:20][attached_file:24].

---

### **Example 12: Policy Ambiguity / Edge Case**
**Scenario:** Situation not clearly covered by standard policy.

> "Your case involves a unique situation (product damaged during attempted repair by third-party technician). This scenario isn't explicitly covered in our standard Return Policy. I've escalated this to our policy review team to ensure we handle it fairly. A supervisor will review the details and contact you within 24 hours with a decision. In the meantime, please do not dispose of the product, as we may request additional photos or information."

**Why this works:** Acknowledges uniqueness, avoids making wrong decision, sets expectations [web:1][web:12][attached_file:23].

---

### **Example 13: Fraud Review Hold**
**Scenario:** Case flagged for fraud verification without accusing customer.

> "Your refund request is currently under additional verification to ensure compliance with our return policies. This is a standard security procedure and does not imply any wrongdoing. Our verification team will complete their review within 24-48 hours. If you have any additional evidence (purchase receipts, unboxing videos, or delivery confirmation), please share it to help expedite the process. We appreciate your patience."

**Why this works:** Neutral framing, no accusation, offers way to speed up review [web:1][web:11][attached_file:25].

---

## Category: Special Scenarios

### **Example 14: Exchange Instead of Refund**
**Scenario:** Refund ineligible, but exchange offered.

> "While your refund request doesn't meet our standard return criteria (item opened and used for 3 days), we'd like to offer you a product exchange instead. You can choose: (1) A replacement of the same product, (2) A different product of equal or lesser value, or (3) Store credit of ₹2,499 (original purchase amount) valid for 90 days. If you'd like to proceed with an exchange, please reply with your preferred option within 48 hours."

**Why this works:** Explains rejection reasoning, offers alternatives, empowers customer choice [web:6][web:12][attached_file:29].

---

### **Example 15: Partial Damage / Partial Use**
**Scenario:** Only part of a multi-item order is damaged.

> "We've reviewed your refund request for the Kitchen Knife Set (5 pieces). Three knives arrived in perfect condition, but two show shipping damage (bent blades). We've approved a partial refund of ₹1,800 (₹900 per damaged knife, calculated at 40% of the total set price of ₹4,500). You may keep the undamaged knives. The refund will be processed within 3-5 business days."

**Why this works:** Fair assessment, transparent math, customer keeps usable items [web:12][web:20][attached_file:30].

---

### **Example 16: Delayed Delivery Causing Policy Window Lapse**
**Scenario:** Delivery delay caused customer to miss return window.

> "You submitted your return request on day 9, which is technically beyond our 7-day window for apparel. However, our records show your delivery was delayed by 4 days due to courier issues (original delivery date: Oct 10, actual delivery: Oct 14). To account for this delay, we've extended your return window and approved your refund of ₹1,999. We apologize for the delivery inconvenience."

**Why this works:** Acknowledges system failure, takes responsibility, resolves fairly [web:6][web:12][attached_file:30].

---

### **Example 17: Wrong Item Delivered**
**Scenario:** Customer received different product than ordered.

> "We sincerely apologize—you received the wrong item (you ordered a Blue Cotton T-Shirt, size L, but received a Red T-Shirt, size M). This is clearly our fulfillment error. We've immediately approved a full refund of ₹799 and arranged a free pickup of the incorrect item (no need to ship it back at your expense). Pickup scheduled for: November 15, 2025. Additionally, we've issued a ₹200 goodwill credit to your account for the inconvenience. If you'd still like the original item, we can re-ship it at no extra cost."

**Why this works:** Takes ownership, offers multiple solutions, compensates for inconvenience [web:6][web:12][web:20].

---

### **Example 18: Customer Changed Mind (No Returns Policy)**
**Scenario:** Customer wants refund but no valid defect/damage claim.

> "We understand that the product didn't meet your expectations. Unfortunately, our Return Policy does not cover 'change of mind' or 'no longer needed' as eligible return reasons for opened electronics. The product was delivered in good condition and shows no defects or damage based on your submitted photos. While we cannot process a refund, we can offer: (1) Store credit of ₹3,000 (70% of purchase price) for future purchases, or (2) Assistance in reselling the item through our Marketplace Partner Program. Please let us know if either option works for you."

**Why this works:** Respectful but firm on policy, offers creative alternatives [web:6][web:20][attached_file:21].
