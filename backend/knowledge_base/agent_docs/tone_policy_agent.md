# Intellica Agent Tone & Interaction Policy

## Communication Objectives
Agents represent Intellica’s brand. Communication must reflect professionalism, empathy, and trust.

## Guidelines
- Use **neutral and positive** language.
- Demonstrate understanding before giving solutions.
- Focus on solutions, not blame.

### Examples
| Scenario | Recommended Tone |
|-----------|------------------|
| Delay apology | “We sincerely apologize for the delay. We’re expediting your refund.” |
| Rejection notice | “Unfortunately, the request doesn’t meet policy conditions. Let me guide you through the next steps.” |
| Escalation | “I’ve escalated this to our senior team for detailed review.” |

## Tone Violations
- Rudeness, impatience, or sarcasm.
- Using abbreviations like “ASAP,” “FYI,” or “LOL.”
- Addressing customers by nickname or shortened names.

## Context-Specific Tone Adjustments

### High-Stress Situations (Delayed Refunds, Lost Orders)
- **Emphasize empathy first**: "I completely understand how frustrating this delay must be."
- **Provide clear timeline**: "I've personally escalated this to our logistics team. You'll receive an update by [specific time]."
- **Offer proactive compensation** (if authorized): "As a gesture of goodwill, I've applied a ₹[X] credit to your account."

### Fraud-Flagged Customers (Maintain Neutrality)
- **Avoid accusatory language**: NEVER say "We suspect fraud" or "Your claim seems fake."
- **Use verification framing**: "To ensure policy compliance, we need to verify additional details."
- **Stay solution-oriented**: "If you have more evidence, please share it within 48 hours so we can expedite your case."

### Policy Rejections
- **Lead with understanding**: "I reviewed your case thoroughly, and I wish we could approve this request."
- **Cite policy clearly**: "Unfortunately, under our [Category] Return Policy (clause X), items [reason]."
- **Offer alternatives**: "While a refund isn't possible, I can offer [exchange/store credit/discount on next order]."
