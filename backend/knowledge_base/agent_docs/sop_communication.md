# Communication SOP – Agents

## Tone & Style
- Always maintain a **professional, polite, and clear** manner.
- Start with empathy: “I understand how frustrating this must be...”
- Use **positive, helpful language** (focus on what can be done).
- Adjust formality to customer’s tone, but never become overly casual or aloof.
- Avoid negative or blaming phrases such as “You must” or “You should have”.

## Channel-specific Guidance

| Channel | Key Behavior |
|---------|--------------|
| **Email** | Respond within SLA, address by name, use proper grammar, never use emojis. |
| **Chat** | Be succinct, acknowledge faster, use friendly sign-off, escalate if stuck. |
| **Phone** | Smile while speaking, confirm details verbally, repeat next steps, express thanks clearly. |
| **SMS/App** | Use brief, actionable language; avoid abbreviations or text lingo. |

## Message Rules
1. Personalize all responses (use customer’s name, order ID).
2. Keep sentences short and avoid jargon.
3. Confirm action items at the end of each message (“I have escalated your ticket…”).
4. Never commit to a refund, compensation, or policy deviation until documented approval is received.
5. If referencing a document or evidence, briefly summarize (“As per our Apparel Returns Policy, items must have tags attached”).
6. For multi-step resolutions, number the steps so the customer knows what to expect.

## Empathy & De-escalation

- Remain composed with upset or frustrated customers: validate the emotion first before solving.
- Apologize for issues in the company’s control (“I apologize for the shipping delay on your order”).
- If the customer is aggressive or uses abusive language, remain neutral and, if necessary, follow escalation protocol.

## Prohibited Practices
- Disclosing internal policy documents or AI model decisions verbatim to customers.
- Making unapproved promises (refunds, compensation, expedited service, legal positions).
- Using abbreviations (e.g., “ASAP”, “FYI”), slang, emojis, or GIFs in any corporate communication.
- Sharing PII or sensitive account details without explicit customer authentication.

## Data Security & Privacy Messaging
- Never ask for full payment card numbers or sensitive account passwords in any channel.
- If a conversation relates to privacy, remind: “For your security, please avoid sharing personal or payment information here.”
- On call/email: If verifying identity, state the privacy policy (e.g., “For your security, I’ll need to ask two verification questions.”)

## Example Messages

**Positive:**  
“Thank you, Ms. Kapoor, for sharing the order details. I’ve reviewed your request and will update you within 24 hours on the next steps.”

**Empathy:**  
“I can see how this experience would be concerning. Let’s work together to resolve this as quickly as possible.”

**Escalation:**  
“Your case requires additional review by our senior team. I’ll keep you updated and share any decisions within 4 hours.”

**Poor/Negative (Do not use):**  
“Send clearer pictures or we can’t help.”  
“You should contact the vendor yourself.”  
“We can’t do anything.”

## RAG/Evidence-based Replies
- When resolving, reference the relevant knowledge base policy (“According to our Apparel Return Policy, Clause 2.1, tags must be present”).
- If citing a decision reason, always tie it to a documented policy or standard operating procedure.
- For ambiguous queries or edge cases, communicate escalation confidently: “Our policies don’t directly cover this scenario, so I’m escalating it for review.”

## Quality Assurance
- All messages are monitored for tone, professionalism, accuracy, and alignment with policy.
- Failure to adhere to SOP impacts agent QA score and may result in retraining.

## Accessibility & Language
- Use simple, accessible language for all customers.
- Offer translation support for non-native speakers upon request.
- If a customer requests alternative formats (e.g., large text, email instead of SMS), accommodate when possible.
