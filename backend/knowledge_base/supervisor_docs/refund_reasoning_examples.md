# Refund Decision Transparency Examples

Intellica promotes decision explainability for all refund outcomes.

## Approved Refund Example
> “Customer provided valid proof of damage within 7 days. Vendor validated defect. Refund aligns with clause 3.2 of refund policy.”

## Rejected Refund Example
> “Refund denied as request exceeded 10-day window. Verified via order timestamp in system logs.”

## Partial Refund Example
> “Vendor delayed delivery by 5 days; partial 15% compensation issued as goodwill gesture.”

## Escalation Decision Example
> “Escalation triggered due to vendor non-response. Supervisor approved refund based on customer-side evidence.”
