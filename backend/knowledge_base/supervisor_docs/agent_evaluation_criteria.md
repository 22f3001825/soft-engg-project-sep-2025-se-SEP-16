# Agent Performance Evaluation Framework

## Objective
Provide fair, data-driven, and transparent evaluation of agent performance to drive continuous improvement, recognize excellence, and identify coaching needs [web:35][web:6][web:12].

---

## Evaluation Cycle
- **Monthly formal evaluation** (1st-3rd of each month).
- **Weekly informal check-ins** (coaching, feedback, encouragement).
- **Quarterly performance review** (tied to compensation/promotions).

---

## Core Metrics (60% of Total Score)

| Metric | Description | Ideal Target | Weight | Data Source |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| **AHT (Average Handling Time)** | Avg. time to resolve a ticket | ≤ 15 mins | 15% | Ticketing system |
| **FCR (First Contact Resolution)** | % tickets resolved in one interaction | ≥ 80% | 20% | Ticketing system |
| **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction)** | Post-resolution customer rating | ≥ 4.5 / 5 | 20% | CSAT survey |
| **SLA Compliance** | % of tickets resolved within SLA | ≥ 98% | 15% | SLA monitoring |

### **Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Performance | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **5 (Exceptional)** | Exceeds targets by ≥10% | Consistently top performer; candidate for promotion |
| **4 (Exceeds)** | Exceeds targets by 5-10% | Strong performer; eligible for bonuses |

## Quality Review Process

### **Step 1: Ticket Sampling (10% Random Sample)**
- Supervisor randomly selects **10 tickets** from each agent's monthly workload.
- Ensures mix of priorities (P1-P4) and outcomes (approved/rejected/escalated).

### **Step 2: QA Checklist Review**

**For each ticket, check:**
- [ ] **Policy compliance**: Decision aligns with category return policy + SOP refund approval.
- [ ] **Evidence review**: Agent reviewed all photos, AI scores, customer history.
- [ ] **Communication quality**: Tone, clarity, personalization per standards.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Ticket notes complete; reasoning logged.
- [ ] **Timeliness**: SLA met; no unnecessary delays.

**Scoring per ticket:**
- Pass (100%): All criteria met.
- Minor issues (80%): 1-2 criteria partially met.
- Major issues (50%): 3+ criteria not met.

**Agent's Policy Adherence Score** = Average of 10 ticket scores.

**Supervisor provides:**
- **Strengths**: What agent did well (specific examples).
- **Areas for Improvement**: What needs work (specific examples + coaching tips).
- **Action Items**: 2-3 concrete goals for next month.
